- Weather Sprint-Day 4
- This is last day of our sprint to complete a working desktop weather app via HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs. This is the finished assignment. In it, we called mulitple APIs to check the weather at locations, check the location names via geographical coordinates, and populated our webpage with that information based on user search inputs. We also have a favorite's list that caches previous locations for quick recall.
- If you're viewing this on github and want to get this code to work on your end, in order to get this website to work, you're going to have to add in your own API keys. You can get them for free at: https://openweathermap.org/api -- For this project, I used the:
    - Current Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/current
    - 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast API: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
    - Geocoding API: https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api
